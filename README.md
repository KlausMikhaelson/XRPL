# HackMatch

## Project Description
The XRPL Hackathon Platform is a web app that helps users build their perfect hackathon teams and showcase achievements on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain. It provides smart team matching, XRPL integration, wallet generation using GitHub, and the ability to earn verifiable proof-of-work NFTs for completed projects.

## Key Features
- **Smart Team Matching**: Our algorithm ensures complementary skills and interests to find the perfect teammates.
- **XRPL Integration**: Mint proof-of-work NFTs and showcase achievements on the fast, sustainable, and cost-effective XRPL.
- **Proof-of-Work NFTs**: Each completed project earns a unique XRPL NFT, building a verifiable portfolio.
- **Easy Web3 Onboarding**: The platform provides built-in wallet generation using Dynamic XYZ, making it easy to get started with Web3 and XRPL.

## Use Case: XRPL Token Issuer for Proof of Winning
The platform uses the XRPL token issuer to provide users with a proof-of-work NFT for their hackathon achievements. This immutable, verifiable record can be shared with employers, partners, and the Web3 community.

Key benefits:
1. **Transparency**: Proof-of-work NFTs on the decentralized XRPL provide a tamper-proof record.
2. **Immutability**: The NFTs cannot be altered or forged, ensuring integrity of accomplishments.
3. **Ease of Implementation**: The XRPL token issuer and Dynamic XYZ simplify wallet generation, making it seamless to reward users.
4. **Matching**: Users can see the experience of other participants using assigned NFTs.

## Technical Details
The platform is built with ReactJS, XRPL token issuer, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Dynamic XYZ. It also uses Tailwind CSS, React Modal, Typewriter Effect, Lucide React icons, and Recharts.

## Getting Started
Visit the website and follow the instructions. If you don't have a wallet, the platform will guide you through generating one using Dynamic XYZ.
