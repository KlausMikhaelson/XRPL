# ConnectCode: A Coding Buddy Matchmaking Platform

## 💡 Inspiration 💡
ConnectCode draws inspiration from popular matchmaking apps like Tinder, aiming to connect developers and programmers based on their skills and talents. As hackathon participants ourselves, we understand the value of finding the right coding buddy. We wanted to create a platform that not only fosters collaboration but also provides a distraction-free communication channel for developers to find their perfect coding partners.

## ⚙️ Functionality ⚙️
It's a decentralized platform where we have focused on keeping it user friendly for all kind of developers as well know web3 is not known for the most userfriendly domain but here with the help of dynamic xyz onboarding kit we have made it as easy as how it is in web2.
Like, dislike and communicate with developers that you're matched with using an end-to-end encrypted chat protocol.

### Landing Page
The landing page introduces users to ConnectCode's mission and functionality. It sets the stage for developers seeking coding partnerships and emphasizes the platform's benefits.

### Connect Dashboard
The heart of ConnectCode is the Connect Dashboard, where users can browse through profiles of fellow developers. Users can like or dislike profiles based on skills, interests, and talents. When a mutual "like" occurs, both users become eligible to communicate with each other.

### Communication Channel
Once a match is established, ConnectCode provides a secure communication channel for users to engage in direct messaging. This feature ensures a distraction-free environment, focused solely on productive coding collaboration.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack 🏗️
- Frontend: The user interface is developed using React, offering an intuitive and responsive design.
- Backend: The backend logic is powered by Express.js, providing a robust foundation for handling user interactions and data management.
- Database: MongoDB is used to store user profiles and match data efficiently.
- Authentication: Firebase authentication ensures secure user registration and login processes.
- RealTime Chat: Firebase realtime database is use to manage the chat system effectively.
